# Claude Code GitHub Action Setup

This repository is configured with the Claude Code GitHub Action to provide AI assistance for development tasks.

## How It Works

Claude Code operates in two modes:

### 🤖 Automatic PR Monitoring (Always On)
- **Automatically reviews ALL pull requests** when they are:
  - Opened
  - Edited
  - Updated with new commits
  - Marked as ready for review
- Provides code review feedback and suggestions without manual triggers

### 💬 Manual Assistance (On Demand)
- Triggered by mentioning `@claude-code` in:
  - Issue descriptions or comments
  - Pull request review comments
  - For specific questions or implementation help

## Setup Requirements

To enable the Claude Code GitHub Action, you need to add your Anthropic API key as a repository secret:

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Navigate to Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
3. Click "New repository secret"
4. Add the following secret:
   - **Name**: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
   - **Value**: Your Anthropic API key (get one from [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com))

## Usage Examples
