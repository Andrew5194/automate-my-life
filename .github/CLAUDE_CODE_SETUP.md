# Claude Code GitHub Action Setup

This repository is configured with the Claude Code GitHub Action to provide AI assistance for development tasks.

## How It Works

Claude Code operates in **manual-only mode** to control costs:

### ðŸ’¬ Manual Assistance (Cost-Effective)
- Only triggered when you mention `@claude` in:
  - Issue descriptions or comments
  - Pull request descriptions or comments
  - Pull request review comments
- **You control when it runs** = You control costs
- Perfect for targeted help when you need it

## Setup Requirements

To enable the Claude Code GitHub Action, you need to add your Anthropic API key as a repository secret:

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Navigate to Settings â†’ Secrets and variables â†’ Actions
3. Click "New repository secret"
4. Add the following secret:
   - **Name**: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
   - **Value**: Your Anthropic API key (get one from [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com))

## Usage Examples

### In PRs (Manual - Cost Controlled)
```markdown
I need help implementing a login feature. @claude can you help me create:
1. A login form component
2. Authentication logic
3. User session management
```

### In Pull Requests
```markdown
@claude please review this code and suggest improvements for performance and security.
```

### In Comments
```markdown
@claude can you help me fix the TypeScript errors in this file?
```

## Features

- âœ… **Code Reviews**: AI-powered code review and suggestions
- âœ… **Implementation Help**: Assistance with feature development
- âœ… **Bug Fixes**: Help identifying and fixing issues

## Authoring

Commits made by Claude Code via GitHub Actions will be authored by:
- **Author**: Claude Code (github-actions bot)

Co-authoring with your GitHub account is only configured for local commits made through Claude Code CLI, not for GitHub Action commits.

## Permissions

The Claude Code action has the following permissions:
- `contents: write` - To make code changes and commits
- `issues: write` - To comment on issues
- `pull-requests: write` - To comment on and review PRs
- `actions: read` - To access workflow information

## Getting Started

1. Add your `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` secret (see Setup Requirements above)
2. Create an issue or PR and mention `@claude` with your request
3. Claude Code will respond with assistance and can make commits if needed

## ðŸ’° Cost Management

This setup is designed to be cost-effective:

- **Manual triggers only** - No automatic reviews that could drain tokens
- **Targeted assistance** - Only ask for help when you need it
- **Specific requests** - Be clear about what you want to minimize token usage

### Cost-Saving Tips:
- Use `@claude` sparingly for complex issues only
- Ask specific questions rather than "review everything"
- Consider using Claude Code CLI locally for frequent tasks

The action is now ready to use! Simply mention `@claude` in any issue or PR to get AI assistance.
